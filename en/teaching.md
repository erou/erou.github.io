# Teaching

I try to gather informations about what I teach or taught. The pages are all in
French.

For my teaching activites since 2022, please the French version of the website.

Since September 2020, I teach for the mathematics department of Université de
Versailles. The courses I taught are the following.

I am also an oral examiner in maths for students in
