Hi, I am Édouard, a high school teacher in mathematics at [lycée Pierre Mendès France](https://www.ert.tn/pmf/) in Tunis, Tunisia.

## Academic experience

I obtained a PhD in mathematics and held a teaching position ([ATER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_Temporaire_d%27Enseignement_et_de_Recherche)) 
in the mathematics department of Université de Versailles. I also taugh in the
computer science department of Université de Versailles.

## Research

I am curious about almost everything related to mathematics,
computer science, and teaching. My main domains of interest are [**computer
algebra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra), [**algorithmic number theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_number_theory), and [**cryptology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).

You can find details (talks, publications, ...) in the [dedicated
page](research).

## Other interests

I also practice and teach **improvisation theatre**, that is why you can also
find [ressources](/impro) (in French) about some "lessons" I gave.
